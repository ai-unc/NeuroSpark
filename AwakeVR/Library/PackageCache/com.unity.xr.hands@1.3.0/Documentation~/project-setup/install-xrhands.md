# Required packages

The XR Hands package contains base classes and utility for hand-tracking, but doesn't implement the feature itself. To use XR Hands, you also need a separate *provider plug-in* package that defines a hand provider. A provider plug-in is a separate package containing XR feature implementations for a given platform.

To see if the provider plug-in package you use supports hand tracking, check the documentation for that package.

To use XR Hands on a device, you must install at least one provider plug-in, either from the Package Manager or by going to **Project Settings** > **XR Plug-in Management** as shown below.
