# OpenXR features

The XR Hands package implements two hand-related features for applications using the OpenXR plug-in and runtime. These features include:

| Feature | Description |
| :---        | :---               |
| [Hand tracking](xref:xrhands-openxr-hands-feature) | Implements the XRHandSubsystem for OpenXR. You must enable this feature to access any hand tracking data.|
| [Meta Aim Hand](xref:xrhands-meta-aim-feature) | Implements the Meta Aim Hand extension to OpenXR. |

You can enable these features on the OpenXR pages of your Project Settings (in the XR Plug-in Management section). The XR Hands package must be installed before the option to enable these features are shown.
