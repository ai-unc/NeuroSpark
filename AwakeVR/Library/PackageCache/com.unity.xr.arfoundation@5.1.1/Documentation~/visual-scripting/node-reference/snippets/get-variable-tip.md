> [!TIP]
> If your [Script Machine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualscripting@1.8/manual/vs-create-graph-on-machine.html#create-a-new-graph-file-from-a-script-machine-or-state-machine) **Source** is set to **Graph**, your graph asset cannot directly reference GameObjects in the scene. Use a Get Variable node to reference instantiated GameObjects.
