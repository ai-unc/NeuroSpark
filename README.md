Virtual Reality for Awake Cranis

ARtemplate.apk is the current "proof of concept" application to load onto the Quest 3 for our initial "Coaching Card" implementation of presenting material on a screen element.

App-debug.apk is a standalone APK designed for Android phones. This APK can be installed on a VR headset but may not work as intended. This APK is a concept demo to have a set of slides and cycle through them with a forward and back button.
